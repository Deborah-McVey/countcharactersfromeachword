# Ruby on Replit

This is a template to get you started with Ruby on Replit. It's ready to go so you can just hit run and start coding!

## Running the repl

Simply hit run! You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Installing packages

To add packages to your repl, we recommend using the Replit packager interface in the left sidebar or using `bundle install` in the shell. Check out the [Bundle docs here](https://bundler.io/guides/getting_started.html).

**Warning: Avoid using `gem install` to add packages.**

Beacuse Ruby repls use [Bundle](https://bundler.io/) under the hood to provide a consistent environment that tracks and installs the exact gems and versions needed, we recommend using `bundle install` instead of `gem install`, which may not work as expected.

## Help

If you need help you might be able to find an answer on our [docs](https://docs.replit.com) page. Feel free to report bugs and give us feedback [here](https://replit.com/support).
